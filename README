This is a basic notecard webapp that can be run in a browser. It was not built by me. It was built by [v0](https://v0.dev).
I am not a coder, and I did not want to take a lot of time away from writing to learn to code. 

Every solution I've tried to find hasn't done what I need it to do.

This web application runs soley in the browser. It imports and exports from [Fountain](https://fountain.io). There are instructions built into the page.

## Future Updates.
I would like to integrate a system to set up throughlines with plot and character to visualize the story better.
